#hw1
Namely - the counting of identical words in the proposed text (excerpt from the English book). In form of a dictionary with count after each word (e.g. marcellus 46 times)
As a word, we will understand any sequence of characters separated from other sequences by special punctuation marks (period, question mark, exclamation point, comma, semicolon, colon, dash, hyphen, parentheses, brackets, braces, apostrophe, quotation marks, and ellipsis) and of course the space (or spaces) and the end of a line (new paragraph) . 
These special characters are certainly not part of the word. Lower and upper case characters are identical.

#hw2
1.	write a code that picks a random word from a list of words from the attached file (you can generate it if you want)
2.	user should reveal the word - you can use a following logic for that - guess a letter and displays letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly. E.g. random word is "GUESS" - user try with "S" - display "_ _ _ S S" and so on
3.	if user guess wrong - display a last result and message e.g. "No luck, the letter "XXX" is not in this word. Try again"
4.	stop application when all the letters have been guessed correctly and show the word and display the number of attempts
